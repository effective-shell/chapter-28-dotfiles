# dotfiles

My personal configuration for the shell, vim and other command line tools.

## Introduction

This project holds my local configuration. To setup the dotfiles, run the 'install' script:

```sh
./install.sh
```

This will configure your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` files (if present) to source the configuration in the `shell.sh` script and `shell.d` folder.
